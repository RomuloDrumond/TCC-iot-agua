# Overview

This repository contains my final graduation course work, in Portuguese "Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso" or TCC, that was named REAL-TIME WATER CONSUMPTION MONITORING SYSTEM VIA WEB, in Portuguese "SISTEMA DE MONITORAMENTO EM TEMPO REAL DE CONSUMO DE ÁGUA VIA WEB". It was an end-to-end Internet of Things (IoT) solution for monitoring water consumption, as in the diagram below:
